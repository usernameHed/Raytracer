# Raytracer

A program that creates synthetic images from a configuration file using a raytracing algorithm.
Built from the ground up in C with Epitech's mini-libX graphic library, pixel per pixel. Manages:
 - lighting
 - brightness
 - shadows
 - object/camera translation
 - object/camera rotation
 - realTime rendering
 - multi-threaded
 - dynamic modification of camera/light/object positioning thanks to multithread opptimisation
 - antialising
 - filters
 - scene saving

Built by a group of 6 students. I was responsable for the display engine, parsing of config files for an infinite number of objects, real-time rendering, antialiasing, multi-threading and scene saving.
